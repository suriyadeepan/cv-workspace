* obj:
	- isolate objs or parts of objs from rest of image
	- background => boring; foreground object => interest
	- need parts of objects sometimes => eg: face
	- super pixels => meaningful segments of image
	

* Background Subtraction:
	- learn a bg model, compare model vs current image,
		subtract bg parts, result => fg objs
	- bg => static or periodically moving parts of scene
	- "codebook" method
	- concept of connected components

* Weakness of bg subtraction:
	- independent pixel model    
	- neighbourhood pixels not considered
 	- a multipart model <= extension of independent model
		- surrounding context is taken into account
		- relative brightness of the neigh. pixels
		- increased computation

* Scene Modelling
	- need a complex higher level scene model  
	   multiple levels b/w fg and bg states
	   timing based method of regulating unmoving fg patches to 
	    bg patches
	- detect, create new model <= global change
	- motion detection
	- global frame differencing <= many pixels change @ once
