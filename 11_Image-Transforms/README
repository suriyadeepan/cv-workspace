 		1. testing the Sobel derivative operator
 			- detects edges, fits polynomial based on
 			   gradient in x or y direction
 		2. tested the SCHARR filter
 			- more accurate than Sobel when kernel size
 			   is small
  	    3. tested the Laplacian filter
 	    	- can be applied for blob detection
 	    	   and edge detection
 	    4. tested Canny Filter
 	    	- advanced edge detection technique
 	    	- edges formed by comparing gradient and
 	    	   high/low threshold values
 	    	- assembles edge pixels into contours
